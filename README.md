This project is developed as part of the *"3D Game Programming"* course, taught by **Michel Buffa**, and is designed to compete in the [**Games On Web 2025**](https://www.cgi.com/france/fr-fr/event/games-on-web-2025)
 competition organized by **CGI** (on theme: *Dream Land*).

## Overview
Fuzzleton is a physics-based 3D game developed in Babylon Js, featuring a teddy bear navigating a chaotically toy-filled kids' bedroom (every child's dream, right?). The game aims to blend platforming, puzzle-solving, and soft action fighting, drawing inspiration from titles like *Fall Guys*, *Human Fall Flat*, *Only Up* and *Gang Beasts*. Ideally, it will support multiplayer gameplay where players compete (in teams) to reach the top and become the ultimate "King of the Room".

## Vision: What Fuzzleton Aims to Be
### **Core Concept**
The game is envisionned as a **battle** where players control teddy bears navigating through an oversized, chaotic **kid's room** full of toys. The goal is to overcome obstacles and **reach the top before others** competitors to become the *"King of the Room"* aka the teddy bear of everyone's dreams.
