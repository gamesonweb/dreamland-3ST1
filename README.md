Developed as part of the *"3D Game Programming"* course, taught by **Michel Buffa**, and is designed to compete in the [**Games On Web 2025**](https://www.cgi.com/france/fr-fr/event/games-on-web-2025)
competition organized by **CGI** (on theme: *Dream Land*).

## What‚Äôs Fuzzleton All About?

Imagine a wild, oversized kid‚Äôs bedroom ‚Äî objects everywhere, chaos reigning supreme, and YOU control a fluffy teddy bear trying to navigate through this playful madness (every child's dream, right?).

Fuzzleton is a **physics-powered 3D platformer** developed in Babylon.js powered by the Havok physics engine. After setting up the physic based game environment and homemade physics character controller for our cuddly hero to take life, but also setting up lights, shadows and a lot more. Your mission? Jump, bounce, find the desired object, and conquer the wildest toy-land obstacles... all while dreaming up your own crazy levels!

**But wait... here‚Äôs the twist:**
Not only can you play the game, but you have to **build your own physics-based levels** ‚Äî quickly and easily through our **level creator**‚Äî and share them with friends (or rivals !) to challenge their teddy bear skills.

## The Vision ‚Äî Why Fuzzleton?
After setting up the basis of the project came fatidic questions: *What do I want to create?*, *How could I make levels integrating physics in a fun and easy way?*: Sure, Blender is fantastic for modeling but long, and exporting files, reconfiguring everything in the game quickly becomes a headache. I have tried Godot too, it is a solid engine too, but the same problems arose for integrating to my Babylon.js project.

So, what was the answer? You guessed it: build my very own level editor, fully integrated into the Babylon game itself! Allowing me to create levels rapidly from various objects models assets kits.
What was at start a simple idea for my to create levels fadter turned into the core concept of my project: The long-run dream is to create a Fuzzelton **community playground** where imagination knows no bounds.
* Navigate your teddy through chaotic kid‚Äôs rooms filled with oversized toys
* Overcome obstacles, bounce and find the hidden object
* Race other players to become the **King of the Room** ‚Äî the teddy bear everyone dreams of!
* And **create your own levels** with a physics-driven level editor that puts the power of design in your hands!

üé´ Think of Fuzzleton as your ticket to a *dream land* where everyones adventure is unique - because *you* build it!
